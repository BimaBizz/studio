# **App Name**: TechFlow Dashboard

## Core Features:

- Role-Based Login: Implement a login system that authenticates users based on their roles (Admin, Supervisor, Leader Teknisi) stored securely.
- Dashboard UI: Design a clear and informative dashboard interface accessible upon successful login, tailored to each user role. The initial design will focus on layout, pending integration with backend data in a later phase.
- User Role Management: A tool will allow Admin to use generative AI to assign roles. The generative AI component uses its reasoning ability to ensure that the user's requested role aligns with existing organizational structure, and that role names follow established conventions, and it then converts the user's requested name into the system's role ID.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep Blue (#2E3192) to convey professionalism and trustworthiness.
- Background color: Light Grey (#F0F2F5), a desaturated near-neutral variant of the primary blue.
- Accent color: Electric Purple (#843AB5) for interactive elements and highlights.
- Font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for a clean, modern, neutral user interface.
- Use a consistent set of professional icons from a library like Tabler Icons, adhering to a consistent style (e.g., outline).
- Employ a grid-based layout with clear spacing and consistent padding to ensure a clean and organized dashboard.
- Use subtle transition animations (e.g., fade-in, slide-in) for a polished and modern feel. Do not over-animate; animations should be functional and purposeful.
